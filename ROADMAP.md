rails generator snippets
rcov - pretty test coverage output
rspec - pretty html specs output
Git support (do git add before reloading files? or between loads/saves?)
rdoc - builtin help using rdoc - somehow for ruby as well
handle really large files (e.g. SQL dump or log file. Probably turn off highlighting)
