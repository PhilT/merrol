Merrol
======
Minimalist Editor for Ruby, Rails and Other Languages

Why
----------------------------------
I noticed, while using other editors I found myself constantly re-arranging windows to get the optimum setup. I thought, "There must be a better way".

I wanted to make an editor that is open not just in source code and in maintainability, enhancement and customization.

I wanted to challenge the conventional editors out there and to take a different approach to editing. One that doesn't involve a mouse but one that can be learnt quickly.

gEdit is a great editor and there are a ton of plugins that get it pretty usable but some are buggy and some are flawed just because of the way gEdit works.

Textmate has some great features but it's not free and open and it's Mac only. It also has problems.

Design Goals
----------------------------------
To get the most of a screen whether it's a 30" desktop or a 13" laptop. Control screens without having to resize windows.

Foremost it will be a Rails and Ruby editor. There will be nothing stopping it being customized for other languages and there will be nothing to stop it being forked or plugins added.

No toolbars, menus, icons or any other extra fluff. Straightforward shortcuts will allow access to all functions.

Robust - All built with well factored, well tested Ruby code

Support for the cutting edge Ruby and Rails tools such as RSpec, jQuery, Haml, Sass

No dialogs - Panels will allow a more versatible way to accept input

Configurable - With everyones friend, YAML. Reload configuration files with the touch of a shortcut

Support multiple instances for loading different application directories
