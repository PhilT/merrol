Minimalist Editor for Ruby, Rails and Other Languages

What
----------------------------------
An editor for Ruby, Rails and supporting langauges, written in pure Ruby using some Rails idioms with an open design to allow customization and enhancement.

Why
----------------------------------
I noticed, while using other editors that I found myself constantly re-arranging windows to get the optimum setup. I was also frustrated by little bugs and design issues. I thought, there must be a better way.

I want to make an editor that is really easy to tweak. Users would be able to fork it and customize it as they saw fit. It will also make use of existing apps such as autotest and rails generators and commands such as grep.

I want to challenge the conventional editor design and take a different approach to editing. One that doesn't involve a mouse but one that can be learnt quickly.

Design Goals
----------------------------------
To get the most out of a screen whether it's a 30" desktop or a 13" laptop. Control screens without having to resize windows. Maximize the workspace.

Foremost it will be a Rails and Ruby editor. There will be nothing stopping it being customized for other languages and there will be nothing to stop it being forked or plugins added.

No toolbars, menus, icons or any other extra fluff. Straightforward shortcuts will allow access to all functions.

It will be robust, built with well factored, well tested, accessible pure Ruby code

There will be no dialogs. Panels will allow a more versatile and accessible way to accept input.

Support multiple instances for loading different application directories
